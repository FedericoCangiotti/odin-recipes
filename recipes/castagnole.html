		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Of Romagna origin, they are small pancakes that are fragrant on the outside and<br />
			soft on the inside, rolled in granulated sugar.<br />
			This cake is typical of carnival, and the most classic version involves the use of anise.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<p><strong>Ingredients for approximately 30 castagnole</strong></p>
			<li>Butter => 40g</li>
			<li>Eggs => 2</li>
			<li>Lemon peel => ½</li>
			<li>Salt => a pinch</li>
			<li>Vanilla pod => 1</li>
			<li>Flour 00 => 200g</li>
			<li>Sugar => 50g</li>
			<li>Anise liquor => 1 spoon</li>
			<li>Baking powder for cakes => 8g</li>
			<p><strong>For sprinkle</strong></p>
			<li>Sugar to taste</li>
			<p><strong>For frying</strong></p>
			<li>Peanut seed oil</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Before forming the balls you can let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. This way the flavors will blend perfectly.</li>
			<li>If you do not like the taste of aniseed you can use schnapps, rum or orange juice.</li>
			<li>Use powdered sugar mixed with a little cinnamon instead of granulated sugar.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut the vanilla pod and take out the seeds, then add them to the sugar 1 and mix.</li>
			<li>In another bowl, place flour, add sugar mixed with vanilla seeds and eggs.</li>
			<li>Add the butter, grated lemon peel and anise liquor.</li>
			<li>Add a pinch of salt and baking powder.</li>
			<li>Start mixing the ingredients with a fork and continue by kneading by hand.</li>
			<li>
				As soon as you have an uniform mixture, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.<br />
				Knead until you have a smooth, soft dough.
			</li>
			<li>
				At this point begin to heat the oil, which should reach a temperature of 170°,<br />
				only in this way will you get castagnole golden just right and cooked on the inside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Move on to forming the castagnole.<br />
				Take some dough from the bowl and make a loaf on a lightly floured surface.<br />
				Then cut out small pieces of dough about 12 g. With this dough you will get about 30.<br />
				Then shape each portion with your hands to make small balls.
			</li>
			<li>
				As soon as the oil is hot, dip a few pieces at a time;<br />
				you can help with a skimmer to transfer them without distorting them.<br />
				Turn the castagnole often with a skimmer to encourage even cooking.<br />
				Then drain your castagnole.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer them to a sheet of straw paper to remove excess oil.<br />
				Place the sugar in a bowl and roll the chestnuts inside the sugar.
			</li>
			<li>Continue in this way for the others and serve your castagnole.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />
		<h3>Food preservation</h3>
		<p>
			It is recommended that the castagnole be eaten freshly, or at most within the day.<br />
			The dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.<br />
			Freezing is not recommended.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>About castagnole</h3>
		<p>
			The recipe for castagnole is very old: an eighteenth-century manuscript volume was found in the state archives<br />
			of Viterbo in which four recipes for castagnole are described, one of which involves baking.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Italian tradition, castagnole are considered one of the symbols of Carnival,<br />
			as is also attested by a proverb widespread in the various Marche dialects.<br />
			It is given below:
		</p>
		<em>
			«Fenito Carnevà, fenito amore<br />
			fenito a fà la pachia da signore<br />
			fenito de stacià farina in fiore<br />
			fenito de magnà le castagnole»<br />
			(IT)
		</em>
		<br /><br />
		<p>
			«Finished carnival, finished love<br />
			finished the gentleman's pact<br />
			finished sifting flour in bloom<br />
			finished eating castagnole»<br />
		</p>
