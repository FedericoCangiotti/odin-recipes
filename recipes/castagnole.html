		<h3>Description</h3>

		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<p><strong>Ingredients for approximately 30 castagnole</strong></p>
			<li>Butter => 40g</li>
			<li>Eggs => 2</li>
			<li>Lemon peel => ½</li>
			<li>Salt => a pinch</li>
			<li>Vanilla pod => 1</li>
			<li>Flour 00 => 200g</li>
			<li>Sugar => 50g</li>
			<li>Anise liquor => 1 spoon</li>
			<li>Baking powder for cakes => 8g</li>
			<p><strong>For sprinkle</strong></p>
			<li>Sugar to taste</li>
			<p><strong>For frying</strong></p>
			<li>Peanut seed oil</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Before forming the balls you can let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. This way the flavors will blend perfectly.</li>
			<li>If you do not like the taste of aniseed you can use schnapps, rum or orange juice.</li>
			<li>Use powdered sugar mixed with a little cinnamon instead of granulated sugar.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut the vanilla pod and take out the seeds, then add them to the sugar 1 and mix.</li>
			<li>In another bowl, place flour, add sugar mixed with vanilla seeds and eggs.</li>
			<li>Add the butter, grated lemon peel and anise liquor.</li>
			<li>Add a pinch of salt and baking powder.</li>
			<li>Start mixing the ingredients with a fork and continue by kneading by hand.</li>
			<li>
				As soon as you have an uniform mixture, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.<br />
				Knead until you have a smooth, soft dough.
			</li>
			<li>
				At this point begin to heat the oil, which should reach a temperature of 170°,<br />
				only in this way will you get castagnole golden just right and cooked on the inside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Move on to forming the castagnole.<br />
				Take some dough from the bowl and make a loaf on a lightly floured surface.<br />
				Then cut out small pieces of dough about 12 g. With this dough you will get about 30.<br />
				Then shape each portion with your hands to make small balls.
			</li>
			<li>
				As soon as the oil is hot, dip a few pieces at a time;<br />
				you can help with a skimmer to transfer them without distorting them.<br />
				Turn the castagnole often with a skimmer to encourage even cooking.<br />
				Then drain your castagnole.
			</li>
			<li>
				Transfer them to a sheet of straw paper to remove excess oil.<br />
				Place the sugar in a bowl and roll the chestnuts inside the sugar.
			</li>
			<li>Continue in this way for the others and serve your castagnole.</li>
		</ol>
