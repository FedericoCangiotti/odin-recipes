        Shape into a ball, wrap in a food bag and let it rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the rest time, remove the dough from the bag and form a sausage.
        Then divide it into 6 equal portions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give the shape of a ball to each portion of dough by kneading it for
        about 30 seconds, so that it becomes smooth and uniform. <br />

        and wait for it to warm up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the wraps on one side for 2 minutes, rotating them continuously
        with one hand to ensure a uniform cooking, then turn them <br />
        and cook them for 2 minutes on the other side until they turn slightly
        golden.
