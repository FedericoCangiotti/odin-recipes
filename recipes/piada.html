		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Flour 00 => 500g</li>
			<li>Lard => 125g (optional)</li>
			<li>Water => 170g</li>
			<li>Fine salt => 15g</li>
			<li>Bicarbonate => 1,5 teaspoons</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bicarbonate is not essential but it is used to make the dough softer</li>
			<li>If you want to obtain a softer piadina, you can replace part of the water dose with milk</li>
			<li>For a vegetarian version, use 80 g extra virgin olive oil instead of lard (recommended)</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the dough by mixing the flour, salt, lard and bicarbonate in a bowl.</li>
			<li>Start kneading and add water in 3 times.</li>
			<li>Transfer the dough to the worktop and continue to knead until a homogeneous dough is obtained.</li>
			<li>Shape into a ball, wrap in a food bag and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>After the rest time, remove the dough from the bag and form a sausage. Then divide it into 6 equal portions.</li>
			<li>
				Give the shape of a ball to each portion of dough by kneading it for about 30 seconds, so that it becomes smooth and uniform.<br />
				Then wrap them again with a food bag and let them rest for another 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>After the rest time, flour the worktop and roll out the balls with a rolling pin up to a thickness of 2-3 mm.</li>
			<li>
				Heat a plate
				<a href="https://www.mopita.it/prodotto/piastra-per-piadine/" target="_blank">(piastra)</a> and wait for it to warm up.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook the wraps on one side for 2 minutes, rotating them continuously with one hand to ensure a uniform cooking, then turn them<br />
				and cook them for 2 minutes on the other side until they turn slightly golden.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Food preservation</h3>
		<p>
			Piadine can be stored in a refrigerator, in an airtight container, for about 2 days.<br />
			They can be frozen once cooked and left to cool.

		<h3>About piada</h3>
		<p>
			The history of piadina romagnola has very ancient origins and dates back to the Etruscan period.<br />
			Thanks to the simplicity and versatility of its preparation, for many centuries the piadina romagnola remained the meal of peasants and poor people.<br />
			Its success began only in the '40s and '50s, when it conquered tourists along the
			<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_romagnola" target="_blank">leading to the sea</a>, thanks to the numerous kiosks that offered this goodness
			at low prices!
