			<br />

			<li>Fine salt to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you use the puff pastry machine to roll out the dough, it is advisable<br />
				to mix two different types of flour, 0 and remilled semola.<br />
				This way you will have a coarser dough.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				First take care of the filling, which will need to rest 12 hours in the refrigerator.<br />
				Take the ham and mortadella, remove the tough parts and from the ham remove the rind (pigskin).
			</li>
			<li>Then cut everything into coarse pieces, including the loin in the same way.</li>
			<li>
				Pass through the meat mincer, with medium size mold collecting the minced meat in a bowl.<br />
				Do not set aside the meat mincer, because you will need it again.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add grated Parmigiano Reggiano, a pinch of salt (not too much, it is already very tasty),<br />
				and a pinch of pepper to the minced meat.
			</li>
			<li>Start kneading with your hands and add the egg.</li>
			<li>Add a grated nutmeg (you can abound).</li>
			<li>Knead with your hands until you have a homogeneous mixture.</li>
			<li>Again, pass everything through the meat grinder using a smaller size this time.</li>
			<li>Knead again by hand, cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 12 hours.</li>
			<li>
				After this time has elapsed, start preparing the egg pasta.<br />
				Pour the flour onto a pastry board and make the classic

				>.
			</li>
			<li>Pour the lightly beaten eggs inside and begin mixing the ingredients with a fork so that the flour slowly gathers on the edges.</li>
			<li>Knead by hand, with a movement from the outside to the inside.</li>
			<li>Continue kneading in this way, rotating the dough, until the mixture is smooth.</li>
			<li>Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>After resting, remove the foil and place the dough on the pastry board.</li>
			<li>
				Crush it with your hands to flatten it and give it a round shape, then roll it out with a rolling pin until you get a very thin sheet.<br />
				So thin that by lifting it you should be able to catch a glimpse of what is behind it.
			</li>
			<li>Cut the puff pastry to make squares 2.5-3 cm in size on each side.</li>
			<li>Place a tip of filling in the center of each square.</li>
			<li>
				Lift one, close it so that it forms a triangle, and lightly pinch the edges.<br />
				Now lower the two side edges, giving it a sort of pinch, and turn the tortellino around your finger.<br />
				Isn't it clear? <a href="https://blog.giallozafferano.it/zialora/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN7666-1-1.jpg" target="_blank">help</a>
			</li>
			<li>Do the same for all the others and arrange them on a tray.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Food preservation</h3>
		<p>
			Freshly made tortellini can be frozen, well separated from each other for 30 minutes and<br />
			then collected together in a freezer bag.<br />
			If you do not want to freeze them, let them dry well and store them for a day in the refrigerator,<br />
			tightly closed in a container, either raw or cooked.

		<h3>About tortellini</h3>
		<p>
			Historian Cervellati, in one of his manuscripts mentions "Tortellum ad Natale" in Bolognese tables as early as the 12th century.<br />
			Historical and literary references appear from the early 1300s, in a recipe in Modenese dialect "torteleti de enula,"<br />
			while in the 1400s the tortellino is even mentioned in a novella by Boccaccio in the "Decameron."
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the important dates for the tortellino is 1904, indeed in that year the Bartani brothers from Emilia,<br />
			participating in the Los Angeles fair, present the tortellino as well as the correct way to preserve them.<br />
			From that moment on, the tortellino becomes known worldwide.
